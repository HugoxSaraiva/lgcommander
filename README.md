# lgcommander.py
lgcommander.py is a Python script for controlling your Smart Lg TV with your PC.
It can be used for gaining access to hidden menus and modes.

## Supported models
Lg has released two TV remote control apps for android smartphones in Google Play app store; each with a list of supported models. One for 2012 models and the other for some earlier models. If your TV is not on those lists, it may not be controllable through a network connection and this script may not work for you.

## Requirements
A PC, with Python 3.x installed, connected to the same network as your Lg TV.

## Usage

See the available options with: `./lgcommander.py --help` or `python3 lgcommander.py --help`

    usage: lgcommander.py [-h] [-c COMMAND] [-H HOST] [-p PORT] [-k KEY]
                      [-P {roap,hdcp}] [--debug]

    Control LG-TV over wifi.
    
    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -c COMMAND, --command COMMAND
                            Command to send to TV
      -H HOST, --host HOST  IP address of device. If not set a multicast request
                            will be made for TVs in your LAN.
      -p PORT, --port PORT  TCP port (default is 8080).
      -k KEY, --key KEY     Pairing key used to connect to TV. Pairing key will be
                            displayed on TV if not provided
      -P {roap,hdcp}, --protocol {roap,hdcp}
                            Protocol to use. Currently ROAP and HDCP are
                            supported. Default is to auto detect the correct one.
      --debug               print debug messages

## Examples:
Show pairing key on TV

    python3 lgcommander.py
Send command 1 to TV with pairing key 999999

    python3 lgcommander.py -k 999999 -c 1
Send command 1 to TV with pairing key 999999 and roap protocol without displaying pairing key on screen

    python3 lgcommander.py -k 999999 -c 1 -P roap
## Some useful codes:

* for EZ_ADJUST menu enter 255
* for IN START menu enter 251
* for Installation menu enter 207
* for POWER_ONLY mode enter 254

*Warning*: Do not enter 254 if you do not know what POWER_ONLY mode is. You can find additional information about menus and modes here: <http://openlgtv.org.ru>

## Problem with latest LG firmware:
If you upgrade your TV firmware to 05.12.05 or later, "Tool Option 3" may be greyed out and you may not be able to make changes.  Please e-mail me if you have a solution to this problem (other than not upgrading).

## Windows users:
You can avoid the black console window if you change the "py" file extension to "pyw".

## Newer LG Smart TV (year 2012) models:

### Benke Tamás:
> I wanted to use your lgcommander script, but I realized that its not working with lg 2012 smart tv series. I made some changes, now its working with the new series, but lg changed the keycodes too. Now, there are keycodes above 255 and ez-adjust, in-start code changed too, but I dont know them yet. I attached my version, if you want to improve yours.

* Benke's version of the script was added as lg_2012_commander.py.
* [ypid](https://github.com/ypid) combined the script into lgcommander.py (use `./lgcommander.py -P roap`).
